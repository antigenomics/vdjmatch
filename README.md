Fast, control-calibrated annotation of **T-cell receptor antigen specificity**.

`vdjmatch` annotates clonotypes in large AIRR repertoires against [VDJdb](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-db)
by fuzzy CDR3 search, reporting a **control-calibrated E-value** (BLAST-style significance against a
background repertoire) and enriched antigen-specificity labels. It is a Python rewrite of the legacy
Java/Groovy vdjmatch, built on the [`seqtree`](https://github.com/antigenomics/seqtree) search core.

> **Status:** early alpha (PyPI `0.0.1`), under active development on `dev`. The "2.0" line is the
> Python rewrite of the legacy Java/Groovy vdjmatch (1.x), which is preserved on the `legacy-java`
> branch (tags `1.1.4`–`1.3.1`).

## Features

- Fetch the latest VDJdb release and annotate AIRR Rearrangement / Cell (paired α/β) samples.
- Extremely fast, multithreaded search of million-scale repertoires (via `seqtree`).
- Control-calibrated **E-values** — single-chain and paired α/β (`vdjmatch.evalue`).
- Custom substitution matrices, including segment-specific (V / NDN / J) scoring; the TCR-specific
  **VDJAM** matrix is bundled.
- Rich per-hit output: ranked hits, CIGAR + alignment match/gap, alignment scores, E-values.
- Epitope-level enrichment summaries; pairwise sample overlap.
- A small command-line interface (`vdjmatch update` / `vdjmatch match`) and a `polars`-native Python API.

## Install (development)

```fish
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
pip install -e .[test,bench]
```

`seqtree` (the search engine) is installed from PyPI as a dependency.

## Python API

One ergonomic entry point — `list[CDR3] → hits` up to `polars df → df + annotation columns` (ids/labels
preserved), single- or paired-chain, against any VDJdb version or a custom reference:

```python
import vdjmatch
ann = vdjmatch.Annotator.latest()                      # or .version("2026-06-11-ZENODO") / .from_path(...) / .from_frame(df)
ann.hits(["CASSIRSSYEQYF", "CASSLAPGATNEKLFF"])        # → long per-hit polars frame
ann.annotate(df, cdr3="junction_aa", locus="locus")    # → df + vdjmatch_{epitope,mhc_class,score,n_hits}
ann.annotate_paired(cell_df, cdr3a="cdr3_alpha_aa", cdr3b="cdr3_beta_aa")
vdjmatch.annotate(["CASS..."])                         # module-level shortcut (cached default reference)
```

**First-hit (adaptive) E-value.** Significance is evaluated at each query's *nearest* VDJdb hit (up to 5
edits, ≤2 ins, ≤2 del): the control's neighbour count grows with the radius, so a distance-1 hit is
significant while a distance-5-only hit is not — noise is rejected without a fixed scope
(`vdjmatch.evalue.first_hit`). Edit-distance and BLOSUM+possig-penalty "nearest" both supported.

## Command line

```fish
vdjmatch update                          # fetch + cache the latest VDJdb release
vdjmatch match sample.tsv                # annotate an AIRR rearrangement sample
vdjmatch match -o run/out --match-v --threads 8 *.tsv
```

`match` writes three TSV files per sample (prefix set by `-o`):

| file | contents |
|------|----------|
| `<prefix>.<sample>.hits.txt`    | every VDJdb match per clonotype — CDR3 alignment, CIGAR, edit counts, score |
| `<prefix>.<sample>.calls.txt`   | one predicted epitope per clonotype with its control-calibrated E-value |
| `<prefix>.<sample>.summary.txt` | epitope-level enrichment (unique clonotypes, reads) |

Key options: `--scope s,i,d,t` (search budget, default `1,0,0,1`), `--matrix {vdjam,none}`,
`--match-v` / `--match-j`, `--no-evalue`. Run `vdjmatch match -h` for the full list.

## Scoring: what works (and what doesn't)

An empirical study on VDJdb (see `appendix/vdjmatch_scoring.tex`; regenerated on the **2026-06-11-ZENODO**
release with composition controls and balanced metrics) settles the scoring question honestly:

- **Hamming distance 1 is the signal:noise optimum** — macro purity (per-epitope mean) falls
  0.49 → 0.07 across edit distance 1–5, a 56× → 2.5× enrichment over chance (reproducing the original
  VDJdb observation, Shugay et al. NAR 2018). The search-ball radius, not the substitution matrix, is
  the dominant lever. (On the dense 2026 release this only shows up once a few 10× mega-studies are
  capped and the random tail is treated as an admixed control — naive pooled purity reads a flat ~0.9.)
- **Central (NDN) substitutions carry the specificity signal** — a mismatch in the CDR3 core most
  often changes specificity (P(same epitope) ≈ 0.31) while near-anchor mismatches are germline noise
  (≈ 0.75); the NDN core is also ~31–34% glycine (insertion/D-gene signature).
- **No amino-acid matrix clearly beats BLOSUM62 — and a genetic-code null ties it.** BLOSUM62 ≈ PAM250 ≈
  structural > Hamming > data-derived VDJAM. Strikingly, **VDJAMr** — a matrix built from the *genetic
  code alone* (how mutationally accessible one AA is from another; `loo_vdjam.codon_dissim`) — matches
  BLOSUM62 (0.581 vs 0.564 @≤2), so TCR CDR3 substitution structure is **generative, not chemical**.
  A published TCR-specific matrix, [tcrBLOSUM](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbae602), does *not* beat
  BLOSUM62 either (0.555 vs 0.567; `bench/tcrblosum_refute.py`) — its same-epitope counts don't transfer.
- **Position-weighting BLOSUM62 does beat it.** Encoding the central-substitution finding as a
  seqtree positional matrix (`PositionalMatrix.from_weights(BLOSUM62, …)`, centre ~2× the borders)
  raises leave-one-out retrieval (balanced PR-AUC) above flat BLOSUM62 in **7/8 held-out epitopes**
  (0.564 → 0.598 @≤2; 6/8 @≤4). The weight is **end-anchored** (offset from each germline anchor,
  Beta-Binomial-smoothed) and BLOSUM severity discriminates exactly where the weight is high (the core).
  For CDR3, *where* a mismatch falls matters more than *which* residue it is; the first-order statistic
  is still the control-calibrated E-value.
- **The V gene is a strong, near-binary prior — partly recovered at near-exact germline identity.**
  Same-V neighbours share the epitope **~45–64%** of the time vs **~6–17%** cross-V (ratio up to ~7×).
  *Loose* CDR1/CDR2 similarity barely predicts it (point-biserial r ≈ 0), but cross-V co-specificity
  **rises monotonically as germline CDR1+CDR2 approach identity** — ~11% at ≥6 mismatches to ~32% at
  edit-0: a real ~3× lift, but only **~half** the same-V level (32% vs 64%), recovered *whole-loop*
  rather than via a sparse pseudosequence (per-position lift flat except CDR2 pos 5; edit-0 bin n≈25,
  noisy). So the germline loops carry part of the V prior at near-exact tolerance; the rest is
  gene-identity-specific (`bench/vregion_decompose.py`, `bench/vpseudo.py`; `vdjmatch.match.vgene`).

## Benchmark

The standing benchmark is the **2026-06-11-ZENODO VDJdb release** (mirrored on the
[`isalgo/airr_benchmark`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isalgo/airr_benchmark) HF dataset, fetched via
`db.fetch_hf`). For the scoring studies it is **composition-controlled** (`_bench.long_list`: keep
epitopes ≥30 clonotypes, cap mega-epitopes to a random 3000, drop spectratype-anomalous spike studies),
with imbalance-robust metrics (`bench/metrics.py`: ROC-AUC + balanced PR/F1). Its highest-confidence
subset — the **shortlist** of clonotype–epitope pairs in **≥2 independent references** (`db.replicated`,
~3000 TRB + ~2000 TRA) — is the gold standard (as in `mhcmatch`), kept separate from the long-list.
Leave-one-out NN annotation (`bench/shortlist_accuracy.py`, subs 1, exact self excluded) reaches
**~44–47% top-1**, modestly above single-reference controls (the dramatic 3× gap on a sparse older
export was an artefact — the dense release makes controls findable too).
